# homeassistant-voice

Voice control for Home Assistant: capture audio → detect speech → transcribe
(transcription_api/Whisper) → match action/device/room aliases → call HA REST API.

Entry point: `main.py`. Each audio input runs in its own `SpeechSource`
thread that spawns a subprocess writing raw s16le to stdout, detects speech
by dB threshold, transcribes the utterance, and pushes the result onto a
shared queue. The main loop reads from the queue, matches commands via
`utils.homeassistant.process_command`, and dedupes repeated commands (same
entity + action) inside `DEDUPE_WINDOW_SEC` (default 2 s) so two mics in
the same room don't trigger twice.

Configure one or many sources via `config.AUDIO_RECORD_CMD` (single) or
`config.AUDIO_RECORD_CMDS` (list of commands, or dict `{name: cmd}` for
nicer log labels). Swap the command to change the audio source — local
`arecord` / `parecord` or `ffmpeg` from an RTSP stream — without touching
code.

## Conventions

- `config.py` is **not** tracked — each deployment has its own. Start from
  `config.py.sample`.
- To ship a code change to a deployment host, commit + push + `git pull` on
  the host. Do not rsync working-tree files.
- `send_homeassistant_command(entity_id, service)` accepts either a string
  or a list of entity IDs sharing a domain; `config.room_entities` may map
  a device to a list when one logical command should hit several entities.
